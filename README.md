# Informative git prompt for zsh

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt)

A `zsh` prompt that displays information about the current git repository. In particular the branch name, difference with remote branch, number of files staged, changed, etc.

(an original idea from this [blog post][]).

## Examples

The prompt may look like the following:

-   `(master ^3 *1)`: on branch `master`, ahead of remote by 3 commits, 1 file changed but not staged
-   `(status +2)`: on branch `status`, 2 files staged
-   `(master *7 ?1)`: on branch `master`, 7 files changed, 1 files untracked
-   `(master !2 *3)`: on branch `master`, 2 conflicts, 3 files changed
-   `(experimental v2 ^3 )`: on branch `experimental`; your branch has diverged by 3 commits, remote by 2 commits; the repository is otherwise clean
-   `(:70c2952)`: not on any branch; parent commit has hash `70c2952`;
    the repository is otherwise clean

Here is how it could look like when you are behind by 1 commits, and have 1 staged files, 2 changed but unstaged file, and 1 untracked files, on branch `master`:

## Prompt Structure

By default, the general appearance of the prompt is:

```
(<branch> <branch tracking> <local status>)
```

The symbols are as follows:

### Local Status Symbols

|Symbol|Meaning
|------|------|
|`branch`|   repository clean
|+n |   there are `n` staged files
|!n |   there are `n` unmerged files
|*n |   there are `n` changed but *unstaged* files
|?2 |   there are 2 untracked files


### Branch Tracking Symbols

Symbol | Meaning
-------|-------
^n |   ahead of remote by `n` commits
vn |   behind remote by `n` commits
vm ^n |   branches diverged, other by `m` commits, yours by `n` commits

### Branch Symbol

When the branch name starts with a colon `:`, it means itâ€™s actually a hash, not a branch (although it should be pretty clear, unless you name your branches like hashes :-)

## Install

1.  Clone this repository somewhere on your hard drive.
2.  Source the file `zshrc.sh` from your `~/.zshrc` config file, and
    configure your prompt. So, somewhere in `~/.zshrc`, you should have:

    ```sh
    source path/to/zshrc.sh
    # an example prompt
    PROMPT='%B%m%~%b$(git_super_status) %# '
    ```
3.  Go in a git repository and test it!

### Haskell (optional)

There is now a Haskell implementation as well, which can be four to six times faster than the Python one. The reason is not that Haskell is faster in itself (although it is), but that this implementation calls `git` only once. To install, do the following:

1.  Make sure Haskell is installed on your system
2.  Run `cabal build` from this folder
3.  Define the variable `GIT_PROMPT_EXECUTABLE="haskell"` somewhere in
    your `.zshrc`

## Customisation

- You may redefine the function `git_super_status` (after the `source` statement) to adapt it to your needs (to change the order in which the information is displayed).
- Define the variable `ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CACHE` in order to enable caching.
- You may also change a number of variables (which name start with `ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_`) to change the appearance of the prompt.  Take a look in the file `zshrc.sh` to see how the function `git_super_status` is defined, and what variables are available.

**Enjoy!**
